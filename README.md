# Product Matching App

This is a product matching build in C++ and Java

This is a ncnn android project, it depends on ncnn library and opencv


## some notes
* Android ndk camera is used for best efficiency
* Crash may happen on very old devices for lacking HAL3 camera interface
* All models are manually modified to accept dynamic input shape
* Most small models run slower on GPU than on CPU, this is common
* FPS may be lower in dark environment because of longer camera exposure time
